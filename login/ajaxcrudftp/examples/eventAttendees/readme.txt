This example could be considered a "complete web app." 

I made it in just under 10 minutes to help members of my volleyball team quickly "opt in" 
to our Wednesday game or not. Prevents about 100 emails during the week of "I'm in" or
"I can't make it this week," or "I'll come but I'll be late", etc etc

It's an incredibly simple app, but shows the power of ajaxCRUD in helping make life 
(and coding) faster and simpler.
